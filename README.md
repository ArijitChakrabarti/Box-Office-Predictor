Background - Why do this?

The most aptly titled Hollywood movie (1945 Musical/Comedy) - "There's no business like show business," aptly encapsulates the point being made here.  Movie marketing is tremendous business.  As per an article filed by the Economic Times in May 2019, it alluded to INR 606 Cr. being spent on movie advertising in India in 2018.  That number has since grown.  Now with Covid 19 causing us to consider investments even more judiciously - it is critical to back the right movies which would make business sense.  However, all the investments in movie investments only help in building the opening weekend of the movie - the so called block buster.  The rest of the weeks are a function of the properties of the movie itself. Hence I will use data to understand which movies to back and predict (basis movie attributes) which of them are going to create a splash in the box office and which ones are going to sink without a trace.

The predictor system uses Random Forest Regressor to determine what is the expected Box Office opening day collections for any specific movie on the basis of its attributes including:

 1. Lead Actor
 2. Supporting Actor
 3. Other Main Actor
 4. Movie Budget
 5. Dialogue Writer
 6. Director
 7. Movie Genre
 8. Music Director
 9. Production Banner
 10. Screens for opening show
